Unlike hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering operates on actual observations (rather than the larger set of dissimilarity measures) and creates a single level of clusters. The distinctions mean that k-means clustering is often more suitable than hierarchical clustering for large amounts of data. k-means treats each observation in your data as an object having a location in space. It finds a partition in which objects within each cluster are as close to each other as possible and as far from objects in other clusters as possible"

    "The main advantage gained in employing a lazy learning method, such as case-based reasoning, is that the target function will be approximated locally, __such as in the k-nearest neighbor__ algorithm. Because the target function is approximated locally for each query to the system, lazy learning systems can simultaneously solve multiple problems and deal successfully with changes in the problem domain.\n",
