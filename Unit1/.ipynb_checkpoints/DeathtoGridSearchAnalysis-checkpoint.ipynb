    "__Hierarchical clustering__ groups data over a variety of scales by creating a cluster tree or dendrogram. The tree is not a single set of clusters but rather a multilevel hierarchy, where clusters at one level are joined as clusters at the next level. This allows you to decide the level or scale of clustering that is most appropriate for your application."

    "__K-means clustering__ is a partitioning method. The data is partitioned into k mutually exclusive clusters and returns the index of the cluster to which it has assigned each observation. Unlike hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering operates on actual observations (rather than the larger set of dissimilarity measures) and creates a single level of clusters. The distinctions mean that k-means clustering is often more suitable than hierarchical clustering for large amounts of data. k-means treats each observation in your data as an object having a location in space. It finds a partition in which objects within each cluster are as close to each other as possible and as far from objects in other clusters as possible"

    "In machine learning, __lazy learning__ is a learning method in which generalization beyond the training data is delayed until a query is made to the system, as opposed to in eager learning, where the system tries to generalize the training data before receiving queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage gained in employing a lazy learning method, such as case-based reasoning, is that the target function will be approximated locally, __such as in the k-nearest neighbor__ algorithm. Because the target function is approximated locally for each query to the system, lazy learning systems can simultaneously solve multiple problems and deal successfully with changes in the problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages with lazy learning include the large space requirement to store the entire training dataset. Particularly noisy training data increases the case base unnecessarily, because no abstraction is made during the training phase. Another disadvantage is that lazy learning methods are usually slower to evaluate, though this is coupled with a faster training phase.\n",

These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data.[1] The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss.[1] Cross-validation is often used to estimate this generalization performance.[2]"
